# Python Files

 - **[Pizza.py](https://github.com/ArvidAnderson/Pizza-Ingredient-Lookup/blob/main/PIzza.py)**
   which is where the gui is located, the program also runs itself from
   this file 
   
 -  **[ **Pizza_Ingredient_Lookup.py**](https://github.com/ArvidAnderson/Pizza-Ingredient-Lookup/blob/main/Pizza_Ingredient_Lookup.py)**
   This file includes all the backend of the gui. (Abstract Factory
   Pattern in here)



# Abstract Factory Pattern

The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
